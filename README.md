**WSL Manager** is a highly customizable Windows Subsystem for Linux distro manager for Windows 10 (at least 19H1) and Windows Server 19H1 (or later).

This program helps you install and manage multiple versions of the same Linux distribution on the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This program is currently under development and may take some time to complete its first function.

Good news! This project was introduced in **BetaPage**!

## FAQ

### The functionality of this tool is already provided by wsl.exe. Why should I use this tool?

This tool is designed to enable the use of WSL functionality in a GUI manner. Of course, it is useful to call wsl.exe directly if you are familiar with using the command line.

However, if you use this tool, you will get additional convenience features that can not be solved by wsl.exe alone.

## Distro manager as a Service

Thanks to the import and export capabilities of WSL, you can now exchange tarball archive files. I'm considering creating a gallery service that will allow you to register and exchange the WSL system itself in the future.

## License

This project follows the MIT license.

This project uses [WslQuery](https://github.com/rkttu/WslQuery) project, which follows GPL v3 license. But this project does not link the WslQuery utility direct.
